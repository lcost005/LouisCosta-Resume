        <div class="subheading mb-5">History MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Louis Costa, a sophomore at the University of California Riverside studying History. I grew up in San Diego and attended Olympian High School. I am also the president and captain of the Rugby team at UCR. I am a good student but I am also a dedicated athlete. I have good time management while also being a diligent worker. In all aspects of my work I put in my best effort and I am meticulous to make sure that it is the best of quality.  <br><br>

        With in my history major I am taking an emphasis on US history. I find that US history is especially interesting and important to our society. In addition to being a history major I am also working towards a minor in Russian. This minor would include the Russian language, but also the russian culture and history as well. The minor and major work well together as some of russian history ties into American history, especially in the 1900's. With in my major I have obtained a high GPA by getting straight A's for my history classes. I have also done very well in my Russian classes too. Academically speaking I am hardworking and never miss an assignment or test. I am always on top of things and make sure they are completed and done with the best effort. I also pay closse attention to detail making sure everything is done exactly as intended.  <br><br>

        I have a lot of experience being a leader. From middle school, to high school, and now in college I have been a leader on sports teams, in the classroom, and in clubs. This has allowed me to become a great team player in all situations as well as being able to take charge and lead a group. Most recently I was voted to be President of the Mens Rugby team at UCR. This has allowed me to take on a lot of responsibilities such as scheduling team bondings, off season games, and practices. Through this process I have become very responsible and learned to plan things accordingly. Not only do I manage the team's schedule but I also manage the jobs of other teamates. One of the responsibilites that I have is I decide what jobs to assign other officers on the team. Even with assigning these jobs to other people I still need to oversee that all the things they get assigned gets done. For instance if I tell the treasurer to collect the fundraising money and transfer it to the team account I have to do it with to make sure that no money is missing. If I assign the secretary to log all the equipment we have stored in the locker I will also be there to make sure that everything is in order. It is a busy job but is necessary to keep the team working.
